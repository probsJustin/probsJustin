# Probably Justin ☢️

## About
I *probably* work in observability, streaming data through clouds I don’t own, instrumenting code I didn’t write, and tracing requests no one can explain.  
Currently leading engineering efforts to build **Agentic AI systems** and **cloud-native observability platforms** that *actually* scale across Azure, AWS, and GCP.  

From **massive data pipelines** to **pharmaceutical traceability**, **FedRAMP compliance**, **mesh networking**, and **sky-tracking**…  
If you can deploy it, trace it, map it, or debug it—I’ve *probably* done it (or broken it trying).

Fun fact: The first album I ever bought was *The Bright Lights of America* by Anti-Flag.  
Still waiting for them to drop a song about OpenTelemetry.

## Interests
- ☁️ Cloud-Native Observability & Auto-Instrumentation (OpenTelemetry / Dynatrace / Datadog)
- 🛰️ Real-Time Aviation Tracking & ADS-B Data (SkyTrace Project)
- 🗺️ Interactive GeoJSON / Map Tile Services (pmtiles, mbtiles)
- 🧩 Distributed System Design & Mesh Networks for Tracing
- 🚀 Building AI-Augmented Self-Correcting Pipelines
- 🐛 Teaching, Mentoring, and Leading Hackathons
- 📦 Kubernetes / Docker / Terraform / IaC Automation
- 🔒 Cybersecurity / Compliance (FedRAMP / Security Gates)
- ⚙️ DevOps & CI/CD (Azure DevOps / Jenkins / GitHub Actions)
- 🎯 Making “local dev” *feel* like production (or at least break the same way)
